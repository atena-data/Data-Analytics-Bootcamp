# Data Analytics Bootcamp
 
I am taking the Data Analytics Bootcamp course from Udemy where I work on 21 real world projects. These projects involve data wrangling and cleaning, visualization and modeling using Python.


## *Case Study 1 - Predict AirBnB Prices in Sydney*

My task is to set the competitive daily accomodation rate for a client's house in Bondi Beach. The owner currently charges $500. We have been tasked to estimate a fair value that the owner should be charging. 
The house has the following characteristics and constraints. 

While developing this model I came to realise that Airbnb can use my model to estimate the fair value of any property on their database, This is effectively a recommendation model for all prospective hosts!

The owner has been a host since August 2010
The location is lon:151.274506, lat:33.889087
The current review score rating 95.0
Number of reviews 53
Minimum nights 4
The house can accomodate 10 people.
The owner currently charges a cleaning fee of 370
The house has 3 bathrooms, 5 bedrooms, 7 beds.
The house is available for 255 of the next 365 days
The client is verified, and they are a superhost.
The cancelation policy is strict with a 14 days grace period.
The host requires a security deposit of $1,500
All values strictly apply to the month of July 2018
